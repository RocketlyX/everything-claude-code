# TDD Workflow

Use this skill to run the tdd workflow in Codex.

## When to use
- Adding new features or fixing bugs.
- You want strict red → green → refactor discipline.
- You need to enforce 80%+ coverage expectations.

## How to run in Codex
1. Open `references/commands/tdd.md`.
2. Follow the steps manually (Codex does not execute slash commands).
