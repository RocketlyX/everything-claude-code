# Code Review Workflow

Use this skill to run the code-review workflow in Codex.

## When to use
- After writing or modifying code.
- Before opening or updating a PR.
- When you need a structured review checklist.

## How to run in Codex
1. Open `references/commands/code-review.md`.
2. Follow the steps manually (Codex does not execute slash commands).
