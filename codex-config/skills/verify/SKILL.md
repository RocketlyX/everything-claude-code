# Verification Workflow

Use this skill to run the verify workflow in Codex.

## When to use
- After completing a change set.
- Before shipping or handing off.
- When you need build/typecheck/lint/test validation.

## How to run in Codex
1. Open `references/commands/verify.md`.
2. Follow the steps manually (Codex does not execute slash commands).
