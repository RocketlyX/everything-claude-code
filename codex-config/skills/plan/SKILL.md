# Plan Workflow

Use this skill to run the plan workflow in Codex.

## When to use
- Starting a complex feature or refactor.
- Requirements are unclear or need risk assessment.
- You need a step-by-step plan before touching code.

## How to run in Codex
1. Open `references/commands/plan.md`.
2. Follow the steps manually (Codex does not execute slash commands).
