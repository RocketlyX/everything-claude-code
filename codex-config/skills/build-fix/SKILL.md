# Build Fix Workflow

Use this skill to run the build-fix workflow in Codex.

## When to use
- Build or test commands fail.
- You need a systematic triage process.
- You want minimal, targeted fixes.

## How to run in Codex
1. Open `references/commands/build-fix.md`.
2. Follow the steps manually (Codex does not execute slash commands).
